# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO SITE

## Project purpose:

This is a simple site to display my completed projects to interested parties, the url of which can be shared with prospective employes to be able to view my work and learn a bit about me.  This also include a contact form which allows the user to email me through the site.

### BRIEF

Build a portfolio site to sell myself, with the following goals:

    1. External userâ€™s goal:    View my completed work and have access to these sites in one place.
                                Have the ability to contact me through the site.

    2. Site owner's goal:       Showcase my completed work on one site that it is easy to find and view.
                                A site that will allow the sharing of one link to my projects instead of multiple links.
                                Allow potential employers to contact me easily through the site.
                                
### User Stories

Before Starting, I started to create some user stories:

    AS a User I want to be able to learn about the developer whom the site is based upon

    As a User I want to be able to contact the developer whom the site is based upon.

    As the site's owner I want to be able to allow easy access to my completed work, so that potential employers can view them and the supporting files from one easy to use portal.

    As the site's owner I want to be able to receive messages that have been sent to me from the site.
    

### Technologies Used

    GITPOD - All the HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT was edited using GITPOD.

    HTML 5 - The structure of the page has been created in HTML5.

    CSS 3       - The pages were styled using SS3.

    FONT AWESOME- Font Awesome was used to provide the icons throughout the project, as required.

    JAVASCRIPT  - Javascript used to provide validate the input for the contact me form to make sure that the user supplied               relevant information and that the email address was in a valid format.

    BOOTSTRAP   - I used Bootstrap to enhance the base HTML for my site, this allowed me to have extras when developing. I                was provided with:
                        Navbar and responsiveness between large and small devices.
                        The grid feature for responsiveness between screen sizes.
                        Positional commands to allow easy centering of divs and menus, as well as being able to position them to the left and right.

    GOOGLE CHROME DEVELOPER TOOLS - Used To Test While Developing, checking output and values during processing. Testing Functions during development, general tesing of website responsiveness

    GIT/GITHUB  - Used for version control with regular commits.  Github was used to deploy the project.

    dillinger.io - This enabled me to write my readme file in markdown, and preview it whilst I was creating the file.

### Git Commits

I have made regular Git Commits during my project for version control and also to allow myself to go back if anything went wrong. I have pushed each of these commits to GitHub, so that the progress of my project can be reviewed. I followed the steps provided by the GitHub site, which were:

    1.  I created a new repository in GitHub called Keith-Morton-Portfolio.

    2.  I opened this repository in Gitpod, using the gitpod button in GitHub.

    3.  I then pulled the Code Institute repository to load all the technologies that I would need.
    
    4.  To add files to be committed, I typed "git add ."

    5.  To check that these files were staged, I typed "git status" (staged files should be in green font)

    6.  To commit these to git, the command "git commit -m "message"", was used. With a meaningful message about the commit     inside the "".

    7.  To push each commit to github I used : git push -u origin master. 

    8.  For each subsequent commit I repeated steps 4, 5, 6 & 7.

### Deployment

I used GitHub to deploy my project.  Following on from my project files being pushed to git hub, I deployed them by:

    1.  Going to the settings section.
    2.  Then under Source I changed the option to "Master".
    3.  And then clicked the save button.

This meant that my project was deployed via GitHub at : https://keefm6776.github.io/Keith-Morton-Portfolio/

### Testing

Each new feature had been tested after each stage of development within the GITPOD environment. This has included:

After deployment the site has been tested for the above on:

    iPhone 7s on portrait screen (iOS 12 - Safari).

    iPhone 7s on landscape screen. (iOS 12 - Safari)

    iPad Air 2 on portrait screen. (iOS 12 - Safari)

    iPad Air 2 on landscape screen. (iOS 12 - Safari)

    Samsung Galaxy s9 on portrait screen. (Android 8.0.0 (Oreo) - Samsung Internet)

    Samsung Galaxy s9 on landscape screen. (Android 8.0.0 - (Oreo) - Samsung Internet)

    Hanns-G 20" widescreen monitor.

I have covered all the main browsers on the Windows 10 platform with this testing. Namely:

    Google Chrome 74.0.3729.108,
    Firefox 66.0.3,
    MS Edge 42.17134.1.0,
    Opera 60.0.3255.56

I have found that the tested screens were all responsive to orientation when applicable, and the site ran as expected in all these scenarios.

I was unable to test Internet Explorer because it would not run on my Windows 10 computer, but I am not particularly concerned as this has a very low market share from between 3-4% from the stats quoted on Wikipedia. At this stage this share would only be decreasing with desktop computers being on the decline and Windows 10 taking over this market with MS Edge.
Resolved Issues:

Manual Testing:

    1.  I have tested all links, to make sure that they load the correct page as per the button in question. 
    2.  I have tested the navbar links to make sure that they jump to the correct section in my site.
    3.  I have tested my contact form to make sure that the name & message fields cannot be left blank.  Also that the email cannot be left blank & that an email has to be of the correct format to be accepted.

Adjustments Made:

    1.  I found the icons in the footer to be too large, causing the icons to spill to second line on small screens.  I reduced the size of the icons by 5px, which rectifies this issue.
    2.  I found on extra small screens that the navbar was sitting over my name on the hero image.  I added padding for the smaller screens only to push my name down to prevent this.
